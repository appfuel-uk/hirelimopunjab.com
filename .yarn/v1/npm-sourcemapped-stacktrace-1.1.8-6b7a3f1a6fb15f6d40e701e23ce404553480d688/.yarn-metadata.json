    "readme": "This is a simple module for applying source maps to JS stack traces in the browser. \n\n## The problem this solves\n\nYou have Error.stack() in JS (maybe you're logging a trace, or you're looking at\ntraces in Jasmine or Mocha), and you need to apply a sourcemap so you can\nunderstand whats happening because you're using some fancy compiled-to-js thing\nlike coffeescript or traceur. Unfortunately, the browser only applies sourcemaps when the\ntrace is viewed in its console, not to the underlying stack object, so you're\nout of luck.\n\n## Demo\n\nhttp://novocaine.github.io/sourcemapped-stacktrace-demo/public_html/smst.html\n\n## Install from npm\n\n```\nnpm install sourcemapped-stacktrace\n```\n\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/sourcemapped-stacktrace\n\nThe npm bundle contains dist/sourcemapped-stacktrace.js, if that's what you're\nafter. The built product is not held in this repo.\n\n## Setup\n\nInclude sourcemapped-stacktrace.js into your page using either an AMD module\nloader or a plain old script include. As an AMD module it exposes the method\n'mapStackTrace'. If an AMD loader is not found this function will be set on\nwindow.sourceMappedStackTrace.mapStackTrace.\n\n## API \n\n### mapStackTrace(stack, done [, opts])\n\nRe-map entries in a stacktrace using sourcemaps if available.\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n- *stack*: Array of strings from the browser's stack representation. \n\n- *done*: Callback invoked with the transformed stacktrace (an Array of Strings) passed as the first argument\n\n- *opts*: Optional options object containing:\n  - *filter*: Function that filters each stacktrace line.\n              It is invoked with _(line)_ and should return truthy/ falsy value.\n              Sources which do not pass the filter won't be processed.\n  - *cacheGlobally*: Boolean. If `true`, sourcemaps are cached across multiple `mapStackTrace()` calls,\n                     allowing for better performance if called repeatedly, or when browser's cache is disabled.\n                     Defaults to `false`.\n\n**Supported browsers**\n  - Chrome\n  - Firefox\n  - Safari\n  - Internet Explorer 11 and up\n  - Microsoft Edge\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\ntry {\n  // break something\n  bork();\n} catch (e) {\n  // pass e.stack to window.mapStackTrace\n  window.mapStackTrace(e.stack, function(mappedStack) {\n    // do what you want with mappedStack here\n    console.log(mappedStack.join(\"\\n\"));\n  }, {\n    filter: function (line) {\n      // process only sources containing `spec.js`\n      return /(spec\\.js)/.test(line);\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\n\n## Longer Explanation\n\nSeveral modern browsers support sourcemaps when viewing stack traces from errors in their native console, but as of the time of writing there is no support for applying a sourcemap to the (highly non-standardised) [Error.prototype.stack](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/Stack). Error.prototype.stack can be used for logging errors and for displaying errors in test frameworks, and it is not very convenient to have unmapped traces in either of those use cases.\n\nThis module fetches all the scripts referenced by the stack trace, determines\nwhether they have an applicable sourcemap, fetches the sourcemap from the\nserver, then uses the [Mozilla source-map library](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/) to do the mapping. Browsers that support sourcemaps don't offer a standardised sourcemap API, so we have to do all that work ourselves.\n\nThe nice part about doing it ourselves is that the library could be extended to\nwork in browsers that don't support sourcemaps, which could be good for\nlogging and debugging problems. Currently, only Chrome and Firefox are supported, but it\nwould be easy to support those formats by ripping off [stacktrace.js](https://github.com/stacktracejs/stacktrace.js/).\n\n## Known issues\n\n* Doesn't support exception formats of any browser other than Chrome and\n  Firefox\n* Only supports JS containing //# sourceMappingURL= declarations (i.e. no\n  support for the SourceMap: HTTP header (yet)\n* Some prominent sourcemap generators (including CoffeeScript, Traceur, Babel)\n  don't emit a list of 'names' in the source-map, which means that frames from transpiled code will have (unknown) instead of the original function name. Those generators should support this feature better.\n",
