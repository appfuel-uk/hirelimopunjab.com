Instead, it's meant to be used in integrations for routing libraries or frameworks. For examples of such integrations, see:**\n\n- [Found Scroll](https://github.com/4Catalyzer/found-scroll): Integration for [Found](https://github.com/4Catalyzer/found)\n- [react-router-scroll](https://github.com/taion/react-router-scroll): Integration for [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) v2 and v3\n\n[![Codecov][codecov-badge]][codecov]\n[![Discord][discord-badge]][discord]\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nimport ScrollBehavior from 'scroll-behavior';\n\n/* ... */\n\nconst scrollBehavior = new ScrollBehavior({\n  addTransitionHook,\n  stateStorage,\n  getCurrentLocation,\n  /* shouldUpdateScroll, */\n});\n\n// After a transition:\nscrollBehavior.updateScroll(/* prevContext, context */);\n```\n\n## Guide\n\n### Installation\n\n```\n$ npm i -S scroll-behavior\n```\n\n### Basic usage\n\nCreate a `ScrollBehavior` object with the following arguments:\n- `addTransitionHook`: this function should take a transition hook function and return an unregister function\n  - The transition hook function should be called immediately before a transition updates the page\n  - The unregister function should remove the transition hook when called\n- `stateStorage`: this object should implement `read` and `save` methods\n  - The `save` method should take a location object, a nullable element key, and a truthy value; it should save that value for the duration of the page session\n  - The `read` method should take a location object and a nullable element key; it should return the value that `save` was called with for that location and element key, or a falsy value if no saved value is available\n- `getCurrentLocation`: this function should return the current location object\n\nThis object will keep track of the scroll position. Call the `updateScroll` method on this object after transitions to emulate the default browser scroll behavior on page changes.\n\nCall the `stop` method to tear down all listeners.\n\n### Custom scroll behavior\n\nYou can customize the scroll behavior by providing a `shouldUpdateScroll` callback when constructing the `ScrollBehavior` object. When you call `updateScroll`, you can pass in up to two additional context arguments, which will get passed to this callback.\n\nThe callback can return:\n\n- a falsy value to suppress updating the scroll position\n- a position array of `x` and `y`, such as `[0, 100]`, to scroll to that position\n- a string with the `id` or `name` of an element, to scroll to that element\n- a truthy value to emulate the browser default scroll behavior\n\nAssuming we call `updateScroll` with the previous and current location objects:\n\n```js\nconst scrollBehavior = new ScrollBehavior({\n  ...options,\n  shouldUpdateScroll: (prevLocation, location) => (\n    // Don't scroll if the pathname is the same.\n    !prevLocation || location.pathname !== prevLocation.pathname\n  ),\n});\n```\n\n```js\nconst scrollBehavior = new ScrollBehavior({\n  ...options,\n  shouldUpdateScroll: (prevLocation, location) => (\n    // Scroll to top when attempting to visit the current path.\n    prevLocation && location.pathname === prevLocation.pathname ? [0, 0] : true\n  ),\n});\n```\n\n### Scrolling elements other than `window`\n\nCall the `registerElement` method to register an element other than `window` to have managed scroll behavior. Each of these elements needs to be given a unique key at registration time, and can be given an optional `shouldUpdateScroll` callback that behaves as above. This method should also be called with the current context per `updateScroll` above, if applicable, to set up the element's initial scroll position.\n\n```js\nscrollBehavior.registerScrollElement(\n  key, element, shouldUpdateScroll, context,\n);\n```\n\nTo unregister an element, call the `unregisterElement` method with the key used to register that element.\n\n### Further scroll behavior customization\n\nIf you need to further customize scrolling behavior, subclass the `ScrollBehavior` class, then override methods as needed. For example, with the appropriate polyfill, you can override `scrollToTarget` to use smooth scrolling for `window`.\n\n```js\nclass SmoothScrollBehavior extends ScrollBehavior {\n  scrollToTarget(element, target) {\n    if (element !== window) {\n      super.scrollToTarget(element, target);\n      return;\n    }\n\n    if (typeof target === 'string') {\n      const targetElement = (\n        document.getElementById(target) ||\n        document.getElementsByName(target)[0]\n      );\n      if (targetElement) {\n        targetElement.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });\n        return;\n      }\n\n      // Fallback to scrolling to top when target fragment doesn't exist.\n      target = [0, 0]; // eslint-disable-line no-param-reassign\n    }\n\n    const [left, top] = target;\n    window.scrollTo({ left, top, behavior: 'smooth' });\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIntegrations should accept a `createScrollBehavior` callback that can create an instance of a custom scroll behavior class.\n\n[build-badge]: https://img.shields.io/travis/taion/scroll-behavior/master.svg\n[build]: https://travis-ci.org/taion/scroll-behavior\n\n[npm-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/scroll-behavior.svg\n[npm]: https://www.npmjs.org/package/scroll-behavior\n\n[codecov-badge]: https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/taion/scroll-behavior/master.svg\n[codecov]: https://codecov.io/gh/taion/scroll-behavior\n\n[discord-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-join%20chat%20%E2%86%92-738bd7.svg\n[discord]: https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bYaNQ46\n",
