Pass `null` to disable this behavior.\n\n### Utilities and Change\n\n`slate-edit-table` exports utilities and changes:\n\n#### `utils.isSelectionInTable`\n\n`plugin.utils.isSelectionInTable(state: State) => boolean`\n\nReturn true if selection is inside a table cell.\n\n#### `utils.getPosition`\n\n`plugin.utils.getPosition(state: State) => TablePosition`\n\nReturns the detailed position in the current table. Throws if not in a table.\n\n#### `changes.insertTable`\n\n`plugin.changes.insertTable(change: Change, columns: ?number, rows: ?number) => Change`\n\nInsert a new empty table.\n\n#### `changes.insertRow`\n\n`plugin.changes.insertRow(change: Change, at: ?number) => Change`\n\nInsert a new row after the current one or at the specific index (`at`).\n\n#### `changes.insertColumn`\n\n`plugin.changes.insertColumn(change: Change, at: ?number) => Change`\n\nInsert a new column after the current one or at the specific index (`at`).\n\n#### `changes.removeTable`\n\n`plugin.changes.removeTable(change: Change) => Change`\n\nRemove current table.\n\n#### `changes.removeRow`\n\n`plugin.changes.removeRow(change: Change, at: ?number) => Change`\n\nRemove current row or the one at a specific index (`at`).\n\n#### `changes.removeColumn`\n\n`plugin.changes.removeColumn(change: Change, at: ?number) => Change`\n\nRemove current column or the one at a specific index (`at`).\n\n#### `changes.moveSelection`\n\n`plugin.changes.moveSelection(change: Change, column: number, row: number) => Change`\n\nMove the selection to a specific position in the table.\n\n#### `changes.moveSelectionBy`\n\n`plugin.changes.moveSelectionBy(change: Change, column: number, row: number) => Change`\n\nMove the selection by the given amount of columns and rows.\n\n#### `changes.setColumnAlign`\n\n`plugin.changes.setColumnAlign(change: Change, align: string, at: number) => Change`\n\nSets column alignment for a given column (`at`), in the current table. `align`\ndefaults to center, `at` is optional and defaults to current cursor position.\n\n> The `align` values are stored in the table node's data.\n> `table.node.data.get('align')` should be an array of aligns, corresponding to\neach column.\n\n### TablePosition\n\nAn instance of `TablePosition` represents a position within a table (row and column).\nYou can get your current position in a table by using `plugin.utils.getPosition(state)`.\n\n#### `position.getWidth() => number`\n\nReturns the number of columns in the current table.\n\n#### `position.getHeight() => number`\n\nReturns the number of rows in the current table.\n\n#### `position.getRowIndex() => number`\n\nReturns the index of the current row in the table.\n\n#### `position.getColumnIndex() => number`\n\nReturn the index of the current column in the table.\n\n#### `position.isFirstCell() => boolean`\n\nTrue if on first row and first column of the table\n\n#### `position.isLastCell() => boolean`\n\nTrue if on last row and last column of the table\n\n#### `position.isFirstRow() => boolean`\n\nTrue if on first row\n\n#### `position.isLastRow() => boolean`\n\nTrue if on last row\n\n#### `position.isFirstColumn() => boolean`\n\nTrue if on first column\n\n#### `position.isLastColumn() => boolean`\n\nTrue if on last column\n",
