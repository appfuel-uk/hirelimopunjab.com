    "readme": "# Relay Library for GraphQL.js\n\nThis is a library to allow the easy creation of Relay-compliant servers using the [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) reference implementation of a GraphQL server.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/graphql/graphql-relay-js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/graphql/graphql-relay-js)\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/graphql/graphql-relay-js/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/graphql/graphql-relay-js?branch=master)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nA basic understanding of GraphQL and of the GraphQL.js implementation is needed to provide context for this library.\n\nAn overview of GraphQL in general is available in the [README](https://github.com/facebook/graphql/blob/master/README.md) for the [Specification for GraphQL](https://github.com/facebook/graphql).\n\nThis library is designed to work with the [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) reference implementation of a GraphQL server.\n\nAn overview of the functionality that a Relay-compliant GraphQL server should provide is in the [GraphQL Relay Specification](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/graphql-relay-specification.html) on the [Relay website](https://facebook.github.io/relay/). That overview describes a simple set of examples that exist as [tests](src/__tests__) in this repository. A good way to get started with this repository is to walk through that documentation and the corresponding tests in this library together.\n\n## Using Relay Library for GraphQL.js\n\nInstall Relay Library for GraphQL.js\n\n```sh\nnpm install graphql graphql-relay\n```\n\nWhen building a schema for [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js), the provided library functions can be used to simplify the creation of Relay patterns.\n\n### Connections\n\nHelper functions are provided for both building the GraphQL types for connections and for implementing the `resolve` method for fields returning those types.\n\n- `connectionArgs` returns the arguments that fields should provide when they return a connection type that supports bidirectional pagination.\n- `forwardConnectionArgs` returns the arguments that fields should provide when they return a connection type that only supports forward pagination.\n- `backwardConnectionArgs` returns the arguments that fields should provide when they return a connection type that only supports backward pagination.\n- `connectionDefinitions` returns a `connectionType` and its associated `edgeType`, given a node type.\n- `connectionFromArray` is a helper method that takes an array and the arguments from `connectionArgs`, does pagination and filtering, and returns an object in the shape expected by a `connectionType`'s `resolve` function.\n- `connectionFromPromisedArray` is similar to `connectionFromArray`, but it takes a promise that resolves to an array, and returns a promise that resolves to the expected shape by `connectionType`.\n- `cursorForObjectInConnection` is a helper method that takes an array and a member object, and returns a cursor for use in the mutation payload.\n- `offsetToCursor` takes the index of a member object in an array and returns an opaque cursor for use in the mutation payload.\n- `cursorToOffset` takes an opaque cursor (created with `offsetToCursor`) and returns the corresponding array index.\n\nAn example usage of these methods from the [test schema](src/__tests__/starWarsSchema.js):\n\n```js\nvar {connectionType: ShipConnection} =\n  connectionDefinitions({nodeType: shipType});\nvar factionType = new GraphQLObjectType({\n  name: 'Faction',\n  fields: () => ({\n    ships: {\n      type: ShipConnection,\n      args: connectionArgs,\n      resolve: (faction, args) => connectionFromArray(\n        faction.ships.map((id) => data.Ship[id]),\n        args\n      ),\n    }\n  }),\n});\n```\n\nThis shows adding a `ships` field to the `Faction` object that is a connection. It uses `connectionDefinitions({nodeType: shipType})` to create the connection type, adds `connectionArgs` as arguments on this function, and then implements the resolve function by passing the array of ships and the arguments to `connectionFromArray`.\n\n### Object Identification\n\nHelper functions are provided for both building the GraphQL types for nodes and for implementing global IDs around local IDs.\n\n - `nodeDefinitions` returns the `Node` interface that objects can implement, and returns the `node` root field to include on the query type. To implement this, it takes a function to resolve an ID to an object, and to determine the type of a given object.\n - `toGlobalId` takes a type name and an ID specific to that type name, and returns a \"global ID\" that is unique among all types.\n - `fromGlobalId` takes the \"global ID\" created by `toGlobalID`, and returns the type name and ID used to create it.\n - `globalIdField` creates the configuration for an `id` field on a node.\n - `pluralIdentifyingRootField` creates a field that accepts a list of non-ID identifiers (like a username) and maps them to their corresponding objects.\n\nAn example usage of these methods from the [test schema](src/__tests__/starWarsSchema.js):\n\n```js\nvar {nodeInterface, nodeField} = nodeDefinitions(\n  (globalId) => {\n    var {type, id} = fromGlobalId(globalId);\n    return data[type][id];\n  },\n  (obj) => {\n    return obj.ships ? factionType : shipType;\n  }\n);\n\nvar factionType = new GraphQLObjectType({\n  name: 'Faction',\n  fields: () => ({\n    id: globalIdField(),\n  }),\n  interfaces: [nodeInterface]\n});\n\nvar queryType = new GraphQLObjectType({\n  name: 'Query',\n  fields: () => ({\n    node: nodeField\n  })\n});\n```\n\nThis uses `nodeDefinitions` to construct the `Node` interface and the `node` field; it uses `fromGlobalId` to resolve the IDs passed in the implementation of the function mapping ID to object. It then uses the `globalIdField` method to create the `id` field on `Faction`, which also ensures implements the `nodeInterface`. Finally, it adds the `node` field to the query type, using the `nodeField` returned by `nodeDefinitions`.\n\n### Mutations\n\nA helper function is provided for building mutations with single inputs and client mutation IDs.\n\n - `mutationWithClientMutationId` takes a name, input fields, output fields, and a mutation method to map from the input fields to the output fields, performing the mutation along the way. It then creates and returns a field configuration that can be used as a top-level field on the mutation type.\n\nAn example usage of these methods from the [test schema](src/__tests__/starWarsSchema.js):\n\n```js\nvar shipMutation = mutationWithClientMutationId({\n  name: 'IntroduceShip',\n  inputFields: {\n    shipName: {\n      type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString)\n    },\n    factionId: {\n      type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLID)\n    }\n  },\n  outputFields: {\n    ship: {\n      type: shipType,\n      resolve: (payload) => data['Ship'][payload.shipId]\n    },\n    faction: {\n      type: factionType,\n      resolve: (payload) => data['Faction'][payload.factionId]\n    }\n  },\n  mutateAndGetPayload: ({shipName, factionId}) => {\n    var newShip = {\n      id: getNewShipId(),\n      name: shipName\n    };\n    data.Ship[newShip.id] = newShip;\n    data.Faction[factionId].ships.push(newShip.id);\n    return {\n      shipId: newShip.id,\n      factionId: factionId,\n    };\n  }\n});\n\nvar mutationType = new GraphQLObjectType({\n  name: 'Mutation',\n  fields: () => ({\n    introduceShip: shipMutation\n  })\n});\n```\n\nThis code creates a mutation named `IntroduceShip`, which takes a faction ID and a ship name as input. It outputs the `Faction` and the `Ship` in question. `mutateAndGetPayload` then gets an object with a property for each input field, performs the mutation by constructing the new ship, then returns an object that will be resolved by the output fields.\n\nOur mutation type then creates the `introduceShip` field using the return value of `mutationWithClientMutationId`.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAfter cloning this repo, ensure dependencies are installed by running:\n\n```sh\nnpm install\n```\n\nThis library is written in ES6 and uses [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) for ES5 transpilation and [Flow](http://flowtype.org/) for type safety. Widely consumable JavaScript can be produced by running:\n\n```sh\nnpm run build\n```\n\nOnce `npm run build` has run, you may `import` or `require()` directly from node.\n\nAfter developing, the full test suite can be evaluated by running:\n\n```sh\nnpm test\n```\n\nWhile actively developing, we recommend running\n\n```sh\nnpm run watch\n```\n\nin a terminal. This will watch the file system run lint, tests, and type checking automatically whenever you save a js file.\n\nTo lint the JS files and run type interface checks run `npm run lint`.\n\n## License\n\ngraphql-relay-js is [MIT licensed](./LICENSE).\n",
