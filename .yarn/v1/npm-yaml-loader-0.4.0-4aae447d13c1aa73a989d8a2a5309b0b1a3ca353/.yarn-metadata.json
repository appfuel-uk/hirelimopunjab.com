If you want a JS Object, chain it with [json-loader](https://github.com/webpack/json-loader).\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install yaml-loader`\n\n## Usage\n\n[Documentation: Using loaders](http://webpack.github.io/docs/using-loaders.html)\n\nSimplest case would be:\n\n``` javascript\nvar json = require(\"json!yaml!./file.yml\");\n// => returns file.yml as javascript object\n```\n\nThis loader is also useful for getting a valid JSON from YML. For example:\n\n```js\n// webpack.config.js\nmodule: {\n  loaders: [\n    {\n      test: /\\.yaml$/,\n      include: path.resolve('data'),\n      loader: 'yaml',\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nand then\n\n```js\n// applicatin.js\nconst actualFilename = require(`file?name=[name].json!./../data/${file}.yaml`);\nwindow.fetch(actualFilename).then(res => {\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\n\n",
