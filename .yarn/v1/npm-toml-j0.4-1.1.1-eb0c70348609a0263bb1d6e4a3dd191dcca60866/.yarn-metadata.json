    "readme": "# TOML-j0.4\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jakwings/toml-j0.4.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jakwings/toml-j0.4)\n[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/toml-j0.4.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/toml-j0.4)\n\nAs its name *TOML-j0.4* says, this is a [TOML] v[0.4.0] compliant parser built\nwith [PEG.js]. You can customize it easily by modifying the grammar file\n`toml.pegjs`.\n\n[TOML]: https://github.com/toml-lang/toml\n[0.4.0]: https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/blob/master/versions/en/toml-v0.4.0.md\n[PEG.js]: http://pegjs.org\n\n\n### Live Demo\n\n<http://jakwings.github.io/toml-j0.4/>\n\n\n### Usage\n\nYou can install it via `npm install toml-j0.4`, or just include the script\n`dist/toml-browser.js` in your web pages.\n\n```javascript\nvar toml = toml || require('toml-j0.4');\n\ntry {\n    var data = toml.parse(src);\n} catch (err) {\n    if (err instanceof toml.SyntaxError) {\n        // do something\n    }\n}\n```\n\n*   `toml.parse` only accept one argument â€” data text in TOML\n*   The instance of `toml.SyntaxError` has these properties:\n    * `line`: the line number\n    * `column`: the column number\n    * `offset`: the zero-based offset from the start of the text\n    * `message`: error message\n\nThere is no other API for now. Simple?\n\n\n### Known Problems\n\n*   JavaScript does not have *real* integers.\n\n    All numbers are floats in JavaScript. Any integer bigger than\n    Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER (9007199254740991 < 2^63 - 1) or smaller than\n    Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER (-9007199254740991 > -(2^63 - 1)) is not safe when\n    being converted or used as pure integer!  Enhancement is welcome!\n\n    I suggest storing big integers in strings.\n\n*   RFC 3339 is not the sole criterion of truth.\n\n    You can't imagine how terrible all minitue details of the standard are! So\n    don't expect some date-times will work anytime and anywhere, for instance,\n    \"2015-02-29T00:00:00Z\", \"2015-12-25T24:00:00Z\", \"2015-11-10T00:60:00Z\",\n    \"2015-11-10T00:00:60Z\", \"2015-12-25T24:00:00+24:00\",\n    \"0000-01-01T00:00:00Z\". Enhancement is welcome!\n\n\n### Contribute\n\nIf you found bugs, welcome to send me a pull request with (only) updated test\nscripts/fixtures!\n\nIn order to test this package thoroughly, you have to do these first:\n\n1.  Clone this project with git.\n2.  Excute this command in the project directory: `npm install`\n\nThe scripts `lib/parser.js` and `dist/toml-browser.js` are generated via this\ncommand:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThen you can test them via this command:\n\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n\nYou can also do some benchmarks with other TOML parsers:\n\n```bash\nnpm run benchmark\n```\n\n\n### Others\n\nThis package is also used by other projects:\n\n*   [tomlify-j0.4](https://github.com/jakwings/tomlify-j0.4)\n*   [meta-matter](https://github.com/jakwings/meta-matter)\n",
