Documentation and code for that release are available on the [`v1-stable`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/tree/v1-stable) branch.**\n>\n> You can send pull requests with v1 bugfixes against the `v1-stable` branch.\n\nA set of components for managing component states (including mounting and unmounting) over time, specifically designed with animation in mind.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [**Main documentation**](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/)\n- [Migration guide from v1](/Migration.md)\n\n## Examples\n\nClone the repo first:\n\n```\ngit@github.com:reactjs/react-transition-group.git\n```\n\nThen run `npm install` (or `yarn`), and finally `npm run storybook` to start a storybook instance that you can navigate to in your browser to see the examples.\n\n[npm-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-transition-group.svg\n[npm]: https://www.npmjs.org/package/react-transition-group\n",
