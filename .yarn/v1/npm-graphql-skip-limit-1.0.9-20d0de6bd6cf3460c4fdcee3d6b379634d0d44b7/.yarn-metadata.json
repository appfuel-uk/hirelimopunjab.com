    "readme": "# graphql-skip-limit\n\nThis library provides helper functions for building Relay-style connections but\nwith skip/limit style pagination instead of Relay's cursor-based pagination.\n\nIt is built and maintained for the\n[React.js static site generator Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) to\ndrive its GraphQL-based data layer.\n\nIt is a port from [graphql-relay](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-relay-js)\nso can be used in a similar fashion. See the tests in `src/connection/__tests__`\nfor an example of using this library.\n\nConnections built with this library can be queried like the following:\n\n```graphql\n{\n  allFile(skip: 1, limit: 10) {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        id\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this query, we skip the first result and limit our results to 10.\n"
