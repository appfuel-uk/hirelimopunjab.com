    "readme": "# rn-host-detect\n\n> Get correctly `localhost` on Android emulator for React Native\n\nOn Android emulator, if you want to connect any servers of local, you will need run `adb reverse` on your terminal. This module made it easier, you can get the localhost IP of host machine directly (`10.0.2.2`, Genymotion: `10.0.3.2`).\n\nThis was done in the following projects:\n\n* [remote-redux-devtools](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/remote-redux-devtools/blob/fbb169173c235eceb136a02a52c6f36b64297910/src/utils/reactNative.js)\n* [reactotron-react-native](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron/blob/f5de09955b870a90cc772bf6c5139ef8e3ecbbba/packages/reactotron-react-native/src/get-host.js)\n\nThat's why you don't need `adb reverse` when you're using these modules on Android emulator.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n$ npm i rn-host-detect --save-dev\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst getHostForRN = require('rn-host-detect')\n\n// '10.0.2.2' or '10.0.3.2' on Android\ngetHostForRN('localhost')\n\n// '192.168.1.111', only convert localhost (or 127.0.0.1) to host IP\ngetHostForRN('192.168.1.111')\n```\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE.md)\n",
