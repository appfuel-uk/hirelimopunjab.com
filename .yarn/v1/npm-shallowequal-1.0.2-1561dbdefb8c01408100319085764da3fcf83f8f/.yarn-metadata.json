    "readme": "# shallowequal [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dashed/shallowequal.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/dashed/shallowequal) [![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/shallowequal.svg)](https://npmjs.com/shallowequal) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/shallowequal.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shallowequal)\n\n[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/dashed/shallowequal.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)\n\n> `shallowequal` is like lodash's [`isEqualWith`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#isEqualWith) but for shallow (strict) equal.\n\n`shallowequal(value, other, [customizer], [thisArg])`\n\nPerforms a ***shallow equality*** comparison between two values (i.e. `value` and `other`) to determine if they are equivalent.\n\nThe equality is performed by iterating through keys on the given `value`, and returning `false` whenever any key has values which are not **strictly equal** between `value` and `other`. Otherwise, return `true` whenever the values of all keys are strictly equal.\n\nIf `customizer` (expected to be a function) is provided it is invoked to compare values. If `customizer` returns `undefined` (i.e. `void 0`), then comparisons are handled by the `shallowequal` function instead.\n\nThe `customizer` is bound to `thisArg` and invoked with three arguments: `(value, other, key)`.\n\n**NOTE:** Docs are (shamelessly) adapted from [lodash's docs](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#isEqualWith)\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n$ npm install --save shallowequal\n$ yarn add shallowequal\n```\n\n```js\nconst shallowequal = require('shallowequal');\n\nconst object = { 'user': 'fred' };\nconst other = { 'user': 'fred' };\n\nobject == other;\n// → false\n\nshallowequal(object, other);\n// → true\n```\n\n## Credit\n\nCode for `shallowEqual` originated from https://github.com/gaearon/react-pure-render/ and has since been refactored to have the exact same API as `lodash.isEqualWith` (as of `v4.17.4`).\n\n## Development\n\n- `node.js` and `npm`. See: https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation\n- `yarn`. See: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install\n- `npm` dependencies. Run: `yarn install`\n\n### Chores\n\n- Lint: `yarn run lint`\n- Test: `yarn run test`\n- Pre-publish: `yarn run prepublish`\n\n## License\n\nMIT.\n",
