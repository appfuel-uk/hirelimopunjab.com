In cases like this, preloading the whole library when application starts is an unnecessary and expensive operation which could possibly slow down your application.\n\nUsing the `Script` component this package provides you with, you can easily load any 3rd party scripts your applications needs directly in a relevant component and show a placeholder while the script is loading (e.g. a loading animation). As soon as the script is fully loaded, a callback function you'll have passed to `Script` is called (see example below).\n\n## Supported React versions\nThis package requires React 0.14.9 and higher.\n\n## API\nThe package exports a single component with the following props:\n\n### `onCreate`\nCalled as soon as the script tag is created.\n\n### `onError` (required)\nCalled in case of an error with the script.\n\n### `onLoad` (required)\nCalled when the requested script is fully loaded.\n\n### `url` (required)\nURL pointing to the script you want to load.\n\n### `attributes`\nAn object used to define custom attributes to be set on the script element. For example, `attributes={{ id: 'someId', 'data-custom: 'value' }}` will result in `<script id=\"someId\" data-custom=\"value\" />`\n\n## Example\nYou can use the following code to load jQuery in your app:\n\n```jsx\nimport Script from 'react-load-script'\n\n...\n\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <Script\n      url=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js\"\n      onCreate={this.handleScriptCreate.bind(this)}\n      onError={this.handleScriptError.bind(this)}\n      onLoad={this.handleScriptLoad.bind(this)}\n    />\n  )\n}\n\n...\n\nhandleScriptCreate() {\n  this.setState({ scriptLoaded: false })\n}\n\nhandleScriptError() {\n  this.setState({ scriptError: true })\n}\n\nhandleScriptLoad() {\n  this.setState({ scriptLoaded: true })\n}\n\n```\n\n## License\nMIT 2016\n\n## Made with love by\n[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d88ee6842f3ff2be96d11488aa0d878793aa67cd/68747470733a2f2f7777772e676f6f676c652e636f6d2f612f626c75656265727279617070732e636f6d2f696d616765732f6c6f676f2e676966)](https://www.blueberry.io)\n",
