Preferes ES6 Module files following `jsnext:main` flag in package configuration. Also respects alternative `style` entries as main package entry point.\n\nThe solution was mainly thought for offering a powerful JSPM-capable include mechanism for PostCSS.\n\n[sponsor-img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/Sponsored%20by-Sebastian%20Software-692446.svg\n[sponsor]: https://www.sebastian-software.de\n[ci-img]:  https://travis-ci.org/sebastian-software/pkg-resolve.svg\n[ci]:      https://travis-ci.org/sebastian-software/pkg-resolve\n[deps-img]: https://david-dm.org/sebastian-software/pkg-resolve.svg\n[deps]: https://david-dm.org/sebastian-software/pkg-resolve\n[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg-resolve\n[npm-downloads-img]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/pkg-resolve.svg\n[npm-version-img]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pkg-resolve.svg\n\n\n## Links\n\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/sebastian-software/pkg-resolve)\n- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg-resolve)\n\n\n## Installation\n\nShould be installed locally in your project source code:\n\n```bash\nnpm install pkg-resolve --save-dev\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIntegrate like this in your e.g. `gulpfile.js` or other packages:\n\n```js\nimport resolver from \"pkg-resolve\"\n\nresolver(\"lodash/map\").then((path) => {\n  console.log(\"Path of lodash/map implementation:\", path)\n});\n\nresolver(\"normalize.css\").then((path) => {\n  console.log(\"Path of normalize.css main entry:\", path)\n});\n```\n\n## Usage for PostCSS\n\nYou are also able to combine the import functionality with [PostCSS Import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import). That's pretty neat to include CSS files and other referenced assets which are installed with JSPM inside the local project.\n\n1. Install normalize.css: `jspm install npm:normalize.css`\n2. Include it via PostCSS include: `@import \"normalize.css\";`\n\n\n## Copyright\n\n<img src=\"assets/sebastiansoftware.png\" alt=\"Sebastian Software GmbH Logo\" width=\"250\" height=\"200\"/>\n\nCopyright 2016<br/>[Sebastian Software GmbH](http://www.sebastian-software.de)\n\n",
