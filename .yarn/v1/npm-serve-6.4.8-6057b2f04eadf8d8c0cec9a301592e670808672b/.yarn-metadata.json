Then this module is exactly what you're looking for: It provides a neat interface for listing the directory's contents and switching into sub folders.\n\nIn addition, it's also awesome when it comes to serving static sites!\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeit/art/4bafffc43b38f3b796eb2f9071292d13d129a7d8/serve/example.png)\n\n## Usage\n\nInstall it (needs at least Node LTS):\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g serve\n```\n\nAnd run this command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nserve [options] <path>\n```\n\n### Options\n\nRun this command to see a list of all available options:\n\n```bash\nserve help\n```\n\n### Authentication\n\nIf you set the `--auth` flag, the package will look for a username and password in the `SERVE_USER` and `SERVE_PASSWORD` environment variables.\n\nAs an example, this is how such a command could look like:\n\n```bash\nSERVE_USER=leo SERVE_PASSWORD=1234 serve --auth\n```\n\n## API\n\nYou can also use the package inside your application. Just load it:\n\n```js\nconst serve = require('serve')\n```\n\nAnd call it with flags (run [this command](#options) for the full list):\n\n```js\nconst server = serve(__dirname, {\n  port: 1337,\n  ignore: ['node_modules']\n})\n```\n\nLater in the code, you can stop the server using this method:\n\n```js\nserver.stop()\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\n1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device\n2. Uninstall `serve` if it's already installed: `npm uninstall -g serve`\n3. Link it to the global module directory: `npm link`\n\nAfter that, you can use the `serve` command everywhere. [Here](https://github.com/zeit/serve/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+for+beginners%22)'s a list of issues that are great for beginners.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis project used to be called \"list\" and \"micro-list\". But thanks to [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/tj) handing us the new name, it's now called \"serve\" (which is much more definite).\n\n## Author\n\nLeo Lamprecht ([@notquiteleo](https://twitter.com/notquiteleo)) - [ZEIT](https://zeit.co)\n",
