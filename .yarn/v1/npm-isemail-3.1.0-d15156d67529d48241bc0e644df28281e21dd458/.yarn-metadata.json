Many thanks to the contributors! Additional tests have been added to increase code coverage and verify edge-cases.\n\nRun any of the following.\n\n```sh\n$ lab\n$ npm test\n$ make test\n```\n\n_remember to_ `npm install` to get the development dependencies!\n\nAPI\n===\n\nvalidate(email, [options], [callback])\n--------------------------------------\n\nDetermines whether the `email` is valid or not, for various definitions thereof. Optionally accepts an `options` object and a `callback` function. Options may include `errorLevel`. The `callback` function will always be called if specified, and the result of the operation supplied as the only parameter to the callback function. `validate()` will synchronously return the result of the operation if no callback is provided.\n\nUse `errorLevel` to specify the type of result for `validate()`. Passing a `false` literal will result in a true or false boolean indicating whether the email address is sufficiently defined for use in sending an email. Passing a `true` literal will result in a more granular numeric status, with zero being a perfectly valid email address. Passing a number will return `0` if the numeric status is below the `errorLevel` and the numeric status otherwise.\n\nThe `tldBlacklist` option can be either an object lookup table or an array of invalid top-level domains. If the email address has a top-level domain that is in the whitelist, the email will be marked as invalid.\n\nThe `tldWhitelist` option can be either an object lookup table or an array of valid top-level domains. If the email address has a top-level domain that is not in the whitelist, the email will be marked as invalid.\n\nThe `allowUnicode` option governs whether non-ASCII characters are allowed. Defaults to `true` per RFC 6530.\n\nOnly one of `tldBlacklist` and `tldWhitelist` will be consulted for TLD validity.\n\nThe `minDomainAtoms` option is an optional positive integer that specifies the minimum number of domain atoms that must be included for the email address to be considered valid. Be careful with the option, as some top-level domains, like `io`, directly support email addresses.\n\n### Examples\n\n```js\n$ node\n> var Isemail = require('isemail');\nundefined\n> var log = console.log.bind(console, 'result');\nundefined\n> Isemail.validate('test@iana.org');\ntrue\n> Isemail.validate('test@iana.org', log);\nresult true\ntrue\n> Isemail.validate('test@iana.org');\nundefined\n> Isemail.validate('test@iana.org', {errorLevel: true});\n0\n> Isemail.validate('test@iana.org', {errorLevel: true}, log);\nresult 0\n0\n> Isemail.validate('test@e.com');\ntrue\n> Isemail.validate('test@e.com', {errorLevel: true}, log);\nundefined\nresult 6\n> Isemail.validate('test@e.com', {errorLevel: 7}, log);\nundefined\nresult 0\n> Isemail.validate('test@e.com', {errorLevel: 6}, log);\nundefined\nresult 6\n```\n\n<sup name=\"footnote-1\">&#91;1&#93;</sup>: if this badge indicates the build is passing, then isemail has 100% code coverage.\n\n[skeggse]: https://github.com/skeggse \"Eli Skeggs\"\n[tests]: http://isemail.info/_system/is_email/test/?allâ€Ž \"is_email test suite\"\n",
